# CourseConnect

### Welcome to CourseConnect! 

Course Connect is an app to **anonymously** connect classmates at the University of Waterloo! Securely login and anonymously create course specific posts to match and chat! Use this for specific assignments, labs, or quizzes for any class such as *wink wink* CLAS104.

## Overview

**Front End**: React Native *with Expo*

**Backend**: FastAPI *with Pydantic Schemas, Websockets, SQLAlchemy*

**Database**: PostgreSQL

**User Authentication**: AUTH0 By Okta

**Chat Implementation**: Websockets (FastAPI <=> React)
